<ul>

    {% if cat.gender == "male" %}
    <il>
        <p>
        <img src = "{{cat.picture}}"><br/>
        {{cat.name}} is a {{cat.gender}} cat and is {{cat.age}} years old

<p>He is the friendliest cat you'll ever meet. No matter who you are; friend, foe, or maintenance worker, he will run right up to you and demand pets.</p>


<h2 class="section-heading">The Neediest</h2>

<p>I cannot sit down for a moment without out him materializing on my lap in an instant.</p>

<p>He will also scream at anyone who is not sitting in such a way that will allow him to comfortably lay on you. With me however, he will find a way. Even if I am laying on my side he is THERE laying on the side of my hip.</p>
